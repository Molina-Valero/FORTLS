## Automatic Processing of Point Cloud Data for Forestry Purposes
Process automation of point cloud data derived from terrestrial-based technologies such as Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). 'FORTLS' enables (i) detection of trees and estimation of tree-level attributes (e.g. diameters and heights), (ii) estimation of stand-level variables (e.g. density, basal area, mean and dominant height), (iii) computation of metrics related to important forest attributes estimated in Forest Inventories (FIs) at stand-level, and (iv) optimization of plot design for combining TLS data and field measured data. Documentation about 'FORTLS' is described in Molina-Valero et al. (2022, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.105337>).

## Normalize

This function obtains coordinates relative to the plot centre for Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and SLAM point clouds (supplied as LAS files) derived from single and multiple scans. 

```r
# Establishment of working directories (optional)
# By default here we propose the current working directory of the R process

dir.data <- getwd()
dir.result <- getwd()

# Loading example data (LAS file) to dir.data

download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/2c3d320o3srcawb/1.las?raw=1", destfile = file.path(dir.data, "1.las"), mode = "wb")

download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/9k8zn5dt0xcxfof/2.las?raw=1", destfile = file.path(dir.data, "2.las"), mode = "wb")

download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/j15lkv0rv2id69e/multiple.scans.las?raw=1", destfile = file.path(dir.data, "multi.scans.las"), mode = "wb")

# Normalizing a single scan point cloud data without considering arguments

pcd.single.scan <- normalize(las = "1.las", dir.data = dir.data, dir.result = dir.result)

# Normalizing a SLAM point cloud data without considering arguments

pcd.multi.scans <- normalize(las = "multi.scans.las", scan.approach = "multi", dir.data = dir.data, dir.result = dir.result)
```

## Tree detection
### Tree detection from Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) single scans point clouds

Detects trees from TLS point clouds corresponding to a single scan. For each tree detected, the function calculates the central coordinates and estimates the diameter at 1.3 m above ground level (which is known as dbh, diameter at breast height) and classifies it as fully visible or partially occluded. Finally, the function obtains the number of points belonging to normal sections of trees (those corresponding to dbh +/- 5 cm) and estimates them for both original and reduced (with point cropping process) point clouds.

```r
# Tree detection without considering arguments
# For this case study, TLS resolution was established as:
# point.dist = 7.67 mm and tls.dist = 10 m

tree.list.tls <- tree.detection.single.scan(data = pcd.single.scan, tls.resolution = list(point.dist = 7.67, tls.dist = 10), dir.result = dir.result)
```
### Tree detection from multi scans or Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) point clouds

```r
tree.list.tls <- tree.detection.multi.scans(data = pcd.multi.scans, dir.result = dir.result)
```

### Tree detection from several plots
For analysis of .las files corresponding to several plots, tree.detection.several.plots is the most appropriate function as it integrates both the normalize and tree.detection functions and allows a character vector containing multiple .las file names to be included as an argument. For instance, all .las files in the dir.data directory can be jointly analyzed as follows.
```r
files <- list.files(pattern = "las$", path = dir.data)[1:2]

tree.list.tls <- tree.detection.several.plots(las.list = files,

                                              max.dist = 15,
                                              algorithm.dtm = "knnidw", res.dtm = 0.25,

                                              dbh.min = 7.5, dbh.max = 100,
                                              breaks = 1.3,
                                              tls.resolution = list(point.dist = 7.67, tls.dist = 10),

                                              dir.data = dir.data, dir.result = dir.result)
```
## Distance sampling
Sampling methodologies are implemented in the `distance.sampling` function. They are designed to correct estimation bias caused by lack of detection of trees due to occlusion. Although this is an optional previous step for other  **FORTLS** functions (such as `metrics.variables` and `simulations`), its inclusion is highly recommended, especially when high rates of occlusion occur. Distance sampling methods are applied to all trees detected from 16 TLS single scans corresponding to plots located in La Rioja (a region of Spain): this is one of the examples included in the **FORTLS** package.
```{r warning=FALSE}
# Load 'Rioja.data' dataset (provided as example data in FORTLS)

data(Rioja.data)

# Select trees detected from TLS data contained in 'Rioja.data' dataset

tree.list.tls <- Rioja.data$tree.list.tls

# Apply distance sampling methods to all detected trees

tree.ds <- distance.sampling(tree.list.tls)
```
## Field data not available

Metrics and variables should be assessed after deciding the most appropriate plot designs based on further previous analysis. The best plot designs can be selected by means of the `estimation.plot.size` function when field data are not available.
```{r warning=FALSE}
# Plot empirical linear charts of density and basal area estimates as a
# function of plot design parameters (radius, k and BAF)

estimation.plot.size(tree.list.tls)

# Plot for mean values

estimation.plot.size(tree.list.tls, average = TRUE)

# Comparing all plot designs

estimation.plot.size(tree.list.tls, all.plot.designs = TRUE)
```
Considering the previous charts, plot design parameters within ranges in which estimated curves for density and basal area are stable can be selected. These ranges are 13-17 m, 12-36 trees and 1.2-1.6 BAF for density; and 13-17 m, 12-36 trees and 0.8-1.2 BAF for basal area. Thus, the following values can be chosen as plot design parameters: 15 m for radius, 24 for number of trees and 1 for BAF.
